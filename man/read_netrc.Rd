\title{Parsing netrc files}
\usage{
read_netrc(x = netrc_path(), std = TRUE, line.number = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE)

netrc_path()
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{path or connection to an netrc file.
Default is to look for file \code{'.netrc'} into the user's home directory.}

\item{std}{indicates if the file should be parsed as a standard netrc file (\code{TRUE}),
searched for R repository specifications (see \emph{Details}) (\code{FALSE}),
or if entries associated with R repositories should be skipped (\code{NA}).}

\item{line.number}{logical that indicates if the starting and ending line number of each
credential definition should also be returned.}

\item{quiet}{logical that indicates if the function should return \code{NULL} if the file is not found,
or throw an error.}
}
\value{
a character matrix with one row per credential and columns \code{'machine'}, \code{'login'}
and \code{'password'} if \code{std} is \code{TRUE} or \code{NA}, and additional columns
\code{'repos'} and \code{'path'} if \code{std = FALSE}.
}
\description{
Parses an netrc file in different ways and return the credential specifications it contains.
}
\details{
Entries in the netrc file can be associated to R repositories, which are looked up
by \code{install.pkgs} via \code{\link{repos_url}}, by adding a comment line
to a standard entry the following format:

\preformatted{
# standard host credential entry
machine www.somehost.org
login tata
password toto

#repos @myRepo/a/b/c
machine www.myrepo.org
login user
password 1234
}

The first entry is standard and provide credentials for a named host.

The second entry starts with \code{'#repos '}, which indicates it is an entry for an R repository
with shortcut key (\code{'@myRepo'}) and an -- optional -- path
to the actual repository on the host machine \code{'www.myrepo.org'}.

Note that it is not mandatory to start the repository entry key with a \code{'@'}, but it makes it clearer
that the first part of the path is a key to be substituted rather than being part of the path.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{netrc_path}: returns the default location of the \code{.netrc} file.
This is by decreasing preference:
\itemize{
\item defined by global option \code{netrc_path}
\item file in current directory
\item file in the user home directory.
}
}}

\examples{

\dontrun{
try( read_netrc() )
read_netrc(quiet = TRUE)
}

# using toy example
f <- system.file('netrc', package = 'repotools')
if( interactive() ) file.show(f) else cat(readLines(f), sep = "\\n")

# standard parsing
read_netrc(f)
read_netrc(f, line.number = TRUE)
# parse repo information
read_netrc(f, std = FALSE)
# skip repo entries
read_netrc(f, std = NA)
